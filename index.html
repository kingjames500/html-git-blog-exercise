    <h2>1. Getting Started</h2>
    <div class="set-up">
        <ul>
            <h3> <i>Setting development environment</i></h3>
            <h3>A. <i>Introduction</i></h3>
            <p>Before diving into using Git, it's essential to set up your development environment. </p>
            <p>This includes installing Git, configuring it, and creating the necessary files and folders for your
                project.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>mkdir my_project</code>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Move into the new directory:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>cd my_project</code>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <code>code .</code>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

    <h2>2. What is GIT</h2>
    <div class="introduction-to-git">
        <ol>
            <li><b>Git</b> is a powerful and widely-used version control system (VCS) that has become an essential tool
                for developers and teams working on projects of all sizes. <br> It helps manage changes to source code
                over time, ensuring that everyone involved in a project can collaborate effectively, track changes, and
                revert to previous versions when necessary.</li>
            <h3>A. <i>What is a Version Control?</i></h3>
            <li>
                <p>A <b>version control system</b> is a software tool designed to help teams manage changes to code or
                    documents over time. It tracks every modification made to a file, allowing users to review the
                    history of changes, collaborate with others without conflicts, and restore previous versions of a
                    project if needed. Version control systems are crucial for maintaining the integrity and history of
                    a project, especially when multiple developers are involved.</p>
            </li>

            <h3>B. <i>Other Version Control Systems</i></h3>
            <p>While <b>Git</b> is the most popular version control system today, it's not the only one. Some other VCS
                options include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Subversion (SVN):</b> A centralized version control system that stores files and their history on
                    a central server. Developers can check out files from the server, make changes, and commit them back
                    to the server.</li>
                <li><b>Mercurial:</b> A distributed version control system similar to Git. It offers many of the same
                    features and benefits, but with a different command-line interface and workflow.</li>
                <li><b>Perforce:</b> A commercial version control system that is popular in the gaming and software
                    development industries. It offers advanced features for managing large codebases and binary files.
                </li>
                <li><b>CVS (Concurrent Versions System):</b> An older, centralized VCS that has largely been replaced by
                    more modern systems like Git and SVN.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>C. <i>Why Focus on Git and GitHub?</i></h3>
            <li>In this blog, we'll focus on Git, as it has become the industry standard for version control due to its
                distributed nature, speed, and flexibility. Additionally, we'll explore GitHub, a popular platform built
                around Git that provides hosting for Git repositories, collaboration tools, and a social coding
                environment. GitHub is where millions of developers share, contribute, and collaborate on projects,
                making it a crucial tool in the modern development landscape.</li>

    <h2>3. Installing Git</h2>
    <div class="install-git">
        <ol>
            <h3>A. <i></i></h3>
            <li>We will start by checking if you have git installed already on you computer by running the above command
                on your terminal or command prompt:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>git --version</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If you have git installed, you will see the version number displayed in the terminal. If not, you will
                see a fatal error in you command prompt or terminal as shown below:
                <img src="./images/git not found.jpg" width="400px">
            </li>
            <li>Download the Git installer for your operating system from the official Git website: <a
                    href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git Downloads</a></li>
            <li>Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Git on your computer.</li>
            <li>Once the installation is complete, open a new terminal or command prompt window and run the following
                command to verify that Git is installed:
                <p><code>git --version</code></p>
            <li>
                <p>The above code will output the git version if it was installed succesfully as shown below.
                </p>
            </li>
            <img src="./images/git version.png" width="400px">
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>4. Configuring Git</h2>
    <div class="configure-git">
        <ol>
            <li>Open a terminal or command prompt window.</li>
            <li>Set your username by usinng the command
                <code>git config --global user.name "you username" as shown on the figure below:</code>
            </li>
            <img src="./images/git name.png" width="400px">
            <li>Set your email address by using the command
                <code>git config --global user.email "you email address" as shown on the figure below:</code>
            </li>
            <img src="./images/git email.png" width="400px">
            <li>You can verify the configuration above by running this command <br>
                <code>git config user.name</code> for verifying if the name is correct. and <br>
                <code>git config user.email for checking if the email is correct.</code>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>5. Creating a Git Repository</h2>
    <div class="create-git-repo">
        <ol>
            <h3>A. <i>What is a Git Repository?</i></h3>
            <p><b>A Git repository</b> is the core of Git, where your project's history and configuration are stored.
                Think of it as a database that tracks all changes made to the files in your project over time. This
                repository allows you to manage different versions of your project, collaborate with others, and easily
                revert to previous states if necessary.</p>
            <h3>B. <i>How to Initialize Repository.</i></h3>
            <li>Open your terminal ama command prompt.
            </li><br>
            <li>Navigate to the directory where you want to create a new Git repository:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>cd path/to/your/projects/my_project</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository in the current directory:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>git init</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li><br>
            <li>The <code>git init</code> command creates a new Git repository in the current directory, enabling
                version control for your project.</li><br>
            <li>After running the above command, you will see a message like this:</li><br>
            <img src="./images/git init.png" width="800px">
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>6. Adding file to the staging area.</h2>
    <div class="staging-area">
        <ol>
            <li>Once youâ€™ve initialized a Git repository and started working on your project, the next step is to
                prepare your files for a commit by adding them to the staging area.</li>
            <h3>A. <i>What is the Staging Area?</i></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The <b> staging area</b> is a space where Git collects changes that you want to include in your next
                    commit.
                    It acts as a preparatory step, allowing you to review and selectively commit changes. In other
                    words, the staging area is like a draft version of your commit, where you can add, remove, or modify
                    files before finalizing them.
                    When you add a file to the staging area, Git starts tracking that file, preparing it to be part of
                    the next snapshot (commit) of your project.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>B. <i>Tracked vs. Untracked Files</i></h3>
            <dl>
                <dt><b>1. Tracked Files:</b> These are files that Git is already monitoring. They can be in one of the
                    following states:</dt>
                <dd><b><i>- Unmodified:</i></b> The file has not changed since the last commit.</dd>
                <dd><b><i>- Modified:</i></b> The file has been changed but not yet staged.</dd>
                <dd><b><i>- Staged:</i></b> The file has been added to the staging area and is ready to be committed.
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>2. Untracked Files:</b> These are files that exist in your working directory but are not being
                    tracked by Git yet. When you first add a file to your project directory, itâ€™s considered untracked
                    until you stage it.</dt>
            </dl>
            <h3>C. <i>How to add files to staging area</i></h3>
            <li>To add files to the staging area, use the <code>git add </code> command. You can add individual files by
                using <code>git add filename.ext</code>, multiple files, or all changes in the directory by using <code>git add . <br>
            </code>as shown in the image below.</li><br>
            <img src="./images/git add.png" width="800px">
            <li>You can always check the status of your filesâ€”whether they are tracked, untracked, modified, or
                stagedâ€”by using the <code>git status </code>command: as illustrated in the figure below, </li><br>
            <img src="./images/git status.png" width="600px">
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>7. Commiting Changes</h2>
    <div class="commiting-changes">
        <ol class="commiting-changes">
            <li>A <b>commit</b> is like a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time, preserving the state of
                the files as they were when you made the commit. Each commit includes a unique identifier, a timestamp,
                the author's information, and a commit message that describes the changes.</li>
            <h3>A. <i>How to Commit Changes</i></h3>
            <li>We use the <code>git commit</code> followed by the <code>-m</code> flag to include a commit message as
                shown in the figure below:</li><br>
            <img src="./images/git  commit.png" alt="" width="800px">
            <h3>B. <i>Writing Good Commit Messages</i></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep it Short and Descriptive,</li>
                <li>Use the Imperative Mood,</li>
                <li>Include Detailed Explanations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>C. <i>Viewing Past Commits</i></h3>
            <li>You can view the history of commits in your repository using the <code> git log</code> command. This
                command displays a list of all commits, including the commit hash, author, date, and commit message:
            </li><br>

    <h2>8. Branches</h2>
    <div class="branches">

        <ol>
            <h3>A. <i>Understanding Branches in Git</i></h3>
            <li>
                <p>Branches are one of the most powerful features in Git, allowing you to work on different versions of
                    a project simultaneously.</p>
            </li>
            <li>A branch is essentially a separate line of development that lets you make changes to your code without
                affecting the main project. You can create a new branch, make changes, and merge those changes back into
                the main branch when you're ready. </li>
            <h4> <i>What is a Branch?</i></h4>
            <p>- A branch in Git is a pointer to a specific commit within the repository.</p>
            <p>- By default, when you initialize a Git repository, it starts with a single branch called main (formerly
                master).</p>
            <li>When you create a new branch, Git creates a copy of the main branch (or any other branch you specify) at
                the current state.</li>
            <li>ou can then switch to this new branch and start making changes without affecting the main branch. This
                new branch can evolve independently, and you can merge it back into the main branch once your changes
                are complete and tested.</li>

            <h3>B. <i>Why Are Branches Important?</i></h3>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Parallel Development:</b> Branches allow multiple developers to work on different features, bug
                    fixes, or experiments simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s work.</li>
                <li> <b>Isolation:</b> By working in a separate branch, you can isolate changes, ensuring that your
                    experiments or unfinished features donâ€™t disrupt the main project.</li>
                <li><b>Safe Collaboration:</b> In a team environment, branches facilitate collaboration by enabling
                    developers to work on their tasks independently.</li>
                <li><b>Version Control:</b> Branches help in managing different versions of a project.</li>
                <li><b>Efficient Workflow:</b> Gitâ€™s branching model is lightweight and efficient, allowing you to
                    create and merge branches quickly. </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
